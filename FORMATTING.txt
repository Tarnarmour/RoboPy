This document contains details on formatting and styling for doc strings, etc.

DOC STRING FORMAT

- Classes: At the class definition, there should be a doc string giving the name and a description of the object
represented by the class, followed by a list of attributes and methods, as shown below:

"""
    MyClass
    Description:
        This class defines an object which does things

    Attributes:
        a - int, a number
        b - list, a list of things
        c - 4 x 4 np.array, an array of numbers

    Methods:
        f1 - returns a value
        f2 - returns another value
"""

- Functions: A doc string should have a first line describing a sample of calling the function with returns, and which
shows the default values for parameters with default values. Following this should be a qualitative description of the
function, a list of parameters, and a list of returns, as shown below:

"""
    y = func(x, z=0.0)
    Description:
        This function does a thing

    Parameters:
        x - string, an array of chars
        z - float, a number, defaults to 0.0

    Returns:
        y - int, a number
"""

COMMENT FORMAT

Comments in code should be done using #. It is strongly preferred to have comments around blocks of code, rather than
line by line, to explain the general details of stuff. Only give line by line comments when a particularly important
and confusing operation is performed.
